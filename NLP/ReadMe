These files were created using Spyder, from Anaconda, using Python version 3.7, and Windows.
Though the original challenge requested a docker-compose virtual machine, the computer on which this code was written could not
install it due to compatibility issues.

In order to run the API, create a virtual environment (in my case using the windows command prompt). Then, inside this environment,
reach the directory where the "PCflask.py" file is saved and run it. This should give you the http address you will need.
Using this address, open a new command prompt, and run "curl address/what you would like to search", or directly in a web browser
write "address/what you would like to search".
Any spaces in our search must be replaced by %20.
Searches will yield only entries which begin with the terms in the search, not if the terms appear anywhere in the name.
Searches are case sensitive.
